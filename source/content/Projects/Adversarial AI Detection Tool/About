Approach

Prompt Injection Detection:

Use rule-based heuristics to identify suspicious patterns (e.g., keywords like "ignore instructions," "bypass," or encoded inputs).
Leverage a pre-trained language model to score input prompts for malicious intent.
Optionally, use embeddings to detect semantic anomalies in prompts.


Anomalous Output Detection:

Monitor model outputs for unusual patterns, such as high perplexity, toxic content, or deviation from expected topics.
Use a secondary classifier to flag outputs as anomalous based on embeddings or sentiment analysis.
Incorporate statistical anomaly detection (e.g., Isolation Forest) for numerical features like output length or token distribution.


Implementation:

Use transformers for language model interactions and embeddings.
Use textblob or vaderSentiment for sentiment/toxicity analysis.
Use scikit-learn for anomaly detection.
Log flagged inputs/outputs for further analysis.
