# 🩹 Hello world!

This is a relatively fresh vault that I will be collecting my occasional notes of my various learning material and research that I invest my free time in across various topics - usually in malware and how to make/fine-tune my own AI models based on open-source models. 

---
## Current Research:
## 2025 

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) open-source hugging face models

### Solo-founder startups 
- akinsec.com - IT Compliance Platform | https://akinsec.com
- solarsystems.tech - selling Custom PCs | https://solarsytems.tech 


## 2024 
- understanding mobile security -> https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF
- addtionally -> https://github.com/ashishb/osx-and-ios-security-awesome
- casestudies on previous -> https://github.com/dfalt0/malware1_casestudy
  
#### iOS security
- Learning C, C++, Rust, & Go via Advent Of Code - https://adventofcode.com/

## Experience:
- 1.5 years of Systems Engineering experience w/ VMware & IoT services
- 2.5 years of Junior Full-Stack Dev in PHP/Laravel via WAMP

## "Projects I'm most proud of"

My most exceptional work is the newest thing that I'm working on, because I'm always trying to get better, be better, and am better - Kaizen mindset

1. AkinSec - my webapp startup that I built/building myself (solo founder) - https://akinsec.com

IT compliance is boring and tedious work - that being said, it's a real contender for having AI be directly implemented in its creation and management, and that's my objective with this startup: to simply and expedite (correctly) the process of managing important IT compliance adherence with laws and regulations for businesses. 

I'm proud of it because I used new tech that I learned about on the go, and got better at existing language stacks as I worked to make it. 

TL;DR - Webapp IT compliance startup made in Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, tRPC, Vercel, Base44

2. Midwest American Transportation Center (MATC) Smart Barrier - Autonomous Vehicle Research with GPS/GNSS 

PhD team research project that focused on developing algorithms for improving lane correction based on the curvature of the current road that a vehicle is occupying at the time of measurement/capture. 

My role was to be the team programmer and GPS researcher - I parsed and refactored MATLAB code into Python to be able to work with the algorithms and the GPS/GNSS modules to measure the realtime data of a moving vehicle, then send that data to a JavaScript, ArcGIS-based, Google Maps-like interface to be able to see what and how the algorithm would suggest the vehicle to correct its lane position to be center on the road.

TL;DR - Built a vehicle-tracking webapp using JavaScript, GPS, and ArcGIS REST API for real-time visualization.
