# Hello world!

KAIZEN - My most exceptional work is the newest thing that I'm working on, because I'm always trying to get better, be better, and am better.

This is a relatively fresh vault that I will be collecting my occasional notes of my various learning material and research that I invest my free time in across various topics - usually in malware and how to make/fine-tune my own AI models based on open-source models. 

---
## Projects
### A.I. Research & LLM Fine-tuning Jan 2025 – Present
• Built training datasets for cybersecurity models that detect obfuscated malware and unsafe code.
• Fine-tuned open-source LLMs like DeepSeek and Qwen3-Coder using QLoRA, Google Colab, and Unsloth.
• Deployed local models with Ollama for private, offline analysis.
### Adversarial AI Detection Tool May 2025 – Present
• Built a tool in Flask with Redis and Ray to spot prompt injections and abnormal behavior in GPT-based apps.
• Runs checks in parallel to scan a large number of prompts quickly.
• Designed to reveal how large language models fail and make them more reliable.
### Hobby / JavaScript Frameworks 2023 – Present
• Built small projects using frameworks like React, Svelte, and Vue.
• Used them to test ideas, learn new patterns, and make faster, cleaner web apps.
### HackerOne Security Research 2022 – 2024
• Found and reported vulnerabilities in web apps and cloud systems through responsible disclosure.
• Worked directly with security teams to improve code and infrastructure security.

## "Projects I'm most proud of"

1. AkinSec - my webapp startup that I'm building myself (solo founder) - https://akinsec.com

Cybersecurity AI startup made in Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Vercel, Base44 

2. Midwest American Transportation Center (MATC) Smart Barrier - Autonomous Vehicle Research with GPS/GNSS 

PhD team research project that focused on developing algorithms for improving lane correction based on the curvature of the current road that a vehicle is occupying at the time of measurement/capture. 

My role was to be the team programmer and GPS researcher - I parsed and refactored MATLAB code into Python to be able to work with the algorithms and the GPS/GNSS modules to measure the realtime data of a moving vehicle, then send that data to a JavaScript, ArcGIS-based, Google Maps-like interface to be able to see what and how the algorithm would suggest the vehicle to correct its lane position to be center on the road.

TL;DR - Built a vehicle-tracking webapp using JavaScript, GPS, and ArcGIS REST API for real-time visualization.
